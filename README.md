# Analysis and Classification of Food Data  

This project focuses on the analysis and classification of food data using formulas derived from the research by **Professor Hong Soon Myung et al.** from *A Basic Study of Food Exchange Database Construction and Search System (ENECC/E-Food Exchange) Based on Internet*. The nutrient standard classifies food into six groups: **Grains**, **Meat**, **Vegetables**, **Fats and Oils**, **Milk**, and **Fruits**, with detailed calculations for determining exchange amounts.

## üìö Food Classification Groups and Formulas  

### 1. Grain  
- **Exchange Unit**: 23g of carbohydrate.  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Cg (carbohydrate per 100g food)} \div 23 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)  

---

### 2. Meat  
- **Exchange Unit**: 8g of protein, with varying lipid and energy values:  
  - Low: 2g lipid, 50 kcal  
  - Medium: 5g lipid, 75 kcal  
  - High: 8g lipid, 100 kcal  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Pg (protein per 100g food)} \div 8 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)  

---

### 3. Vegetables  
- **Exchange Unit**: 3g carbohydrate, 2g protein, 20 kcal energy.  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Cg (carbohydrate per 100g food)} \div 3 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)  

---

### 4. Fats and Oils  
- **Exchange Unit**: 5g of fat, 45 kcal energy.  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Fg (fat per 100g food)} \div 5 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)  

---

### 5. Milk  
- **Exchange Unit**: 11g carbohydrate, 6g protein, 6g fat, 125 kcal energy.  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Cg (carbohydrate per 100g food)} \div 11 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)  

---

### 6. Fruits  
- **Exchange Unit**: 12g of sugar, 50 kcal energy.  
#### Calculation Formula:  
- **I-1**: \( \text{Cg (carbohydrate per 100g food)} \div 12 \)  
- **I-2**: \( 100g \div \text{(Number of exchanges)} \)

## üìÇ Dataset and Documentation  
- This project uses a detailed dataset on food components to calculate exchange values for each group.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Implementation  
- Python for data processing and analysis.  
- Visualization of exchange values across food groups.  
- Integration with the nutrient standards for classification.  

---

## üåç Impact  
This classification system provides a framework for building a robust **Food Exchange Database** and serves as a foundation for nutritional planning, dietary guidelines, and food search systems.
